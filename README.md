AT LAST! The Elves have a Project Manager!

Next up a Librarian/Archivist to help them get their documentation in order.

And, at some point, someone to fix their data structures and processes...

### Part 1
This was simple enough, count how many times we end on zero. Obviously parsing their bizzare input files is the oddest part of all this.

As a result, this is a horrible bruite force method which manually clicks the dial and checks for zero on each click in the instruction set. 

This is wrong, all wrong...
